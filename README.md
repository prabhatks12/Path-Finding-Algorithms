# Path-Finding-Algorithms-

Purpose of this project is to apply as many algorithms as possible to make player reach the food. **It is an on going project.**

Algorithms which are applied:
1. `Free play` : Use keyboard to move player around the board
2. `Random` : Randomly move the player
3. `Manhattan` : Choose the next position which is closer to food based on Manhattan distance between food and new position
4. `Euclidean` : Choose the next position which is closer to food based on Euclidean distance between food and new position
5. `Breadth First Search` : Shortest path based on BFS
6. `Depth First Search` : Shortest path based on DFS
7. `A Star` : Applying heuristic

Future Implementation:
1. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT
2. Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning
