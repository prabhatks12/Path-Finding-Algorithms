#Todo:
1. Change player's position from [(  )] to (), easier to read
2. Try to have only one function for all movements, have 2 now only because of random
3. Utility: Change the equation for Manhattan and Euclidean
4. Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or Pacman specific heuristic functions).
5. Classical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner).
6. Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP).
7. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP).
8. Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP).
